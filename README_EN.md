## Purpose of this project.

- First time using Python to create a GUI program.

- A practice run for Python beginners.

- A lightweight tool that doesn't need to be connected to the Internet.

- Convert the sensitivity of different FPS games.

## Description:
Often times when we need to switch our sensitivity to another game, we need to go to Google and find a web version.  
  
We need to go to Google to find a web-based sensitivity conversion calculator.  
  
But this is time consuming and the browser will consume the performance of the computer.  
  
That's why I created this tool just for myself.
